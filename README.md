# Semantic-Spatial-Aware-GAN-and-BERT

This project was for Recent Trend in Machine Learning course at Asian Institute of Technology.
In this project, we did the follwoing tasks.
- Downloaded a car image dataset from Kaggle.
- Selected some car company and some specific cars models and write a text dataset for training and validation.
- Reduced the layers inside architecutre to fit on our server for training since original architecutre requrire too big GPU memory.
- Adjusted some hyper-parameters during training and monitor the result.
- For further improvement,
  - We can get good qualiy result if we did not need to modify original acrhitecture.
  - We could improve the result, if we focus more on training which affects the models (data-centric approach); we did not know about it at that time.
  
** Detail implementation and experiments is expressed in the paper. **
